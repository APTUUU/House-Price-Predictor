# Project Title: Predicting House Prices with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project involves predicting house prices using the Ames Housing dataset. It is split into two main parts:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: In this part, we perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and data preparation for modeling. The main objective is to get the data into a suitable format for machine learning.

2. **Model Training and Testing**: Here, we build and evaluate a regression model to predict house prices. We use the ElasticNet model and conduct a grid search for hyperparameter tuning.

## Data Preprocessing (Preprocessing.py)

### Introduction
- Description of the project and its purpose.
- Introduction to the Ames Housing dataset.
- Installation requirements.

### Features Description
- Explanation of the dataset's features.
- The types of features and their meaning.

### Loading Data
- How to load the dataset into Python.
- Checking the size of the DataFrame.
- Examining the feature types.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzing the target feature (SalePrice).
- Identifying the most significant numerical features.
- Visualizing important features (e.g., Overall Quality, Living Area, Year Built).
- Handling missing data.
- Addressing outliers.

### Cleaning Data - NaN Values
- Detecting and managing missing data.
- Filling in missing data where appropriate.
- Removing redundant or irrelevant columns.

### Feature Engineering
- Creating new features.
- Handling numerical features that lack ordinal meaning.

### Skewness and Normalizing Variables
- Addressing skewed data.
- Normalizing numerical variables.
